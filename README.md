## How I Feel About AI

Let's be honest: I have a strong dislike for AI.  
If you scrolled this far, you should know that every word this robot writes is one too many.  
I use code, not cogs.  
AI, stay in your lane (preferably, far away from mine).  
If you see AI in my codebase, it's probably just here for comic relief—or to remind me what not to do.
